## Objective

Jackpot! You've landed a summer gig in Las Vegas! Unfortunately, its 2021, and the casinos are closed due to COVID-19. Your boss wants to move some of the business online and asks you to build a fullstack app â€” a simple slot machine game, with a little twist. Build it to ensure that the house always wins!

## Brief

When a player starts a game/session, they are allocated 10 credits. 
Pulling the machine lever (rolling the slots) costs 1 credit. 
The game screen has 1 row with 3 blocks. 
For player to win the roll, they have to get the same symbol in each block.
There are 4 possible symbols: cherry (10 credits reward), lemon (20 credits reward), orange (30 credits reward), and watermelon (40 credits reward).
The game (session) state has to be kept on server.
If the player keeps winning, they can play forever, but the house has something to say about that...
There is  CASH OUT button on the screen, but there's a twist there as well.
